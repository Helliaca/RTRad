# RTRad

## What is it?

RTRad is an enhanced implementation of *progressive refinement radiosity* using Nvidia's RTX technology to accelerate visibility calculations.

The project is built on [Falcor 4.4](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor/releases/tag/4.4) and contains a highly configureable pipeline.
GI lightmaps can be generated in a variety of different ways and individual data components can easily be visualized. Custom scenes and models can be defined and loaded into the rendering environment using the `.pyscene` format.

The development took place as part of a Masters's thesis at the [Freie Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.fu-berlin.de/). The thesis contains a detailed account on all features and requirements. It can be viewed and used as a form of documentation [here](https://www.todo.com/).

Here's a simple demonstration video that serves as an overview:
